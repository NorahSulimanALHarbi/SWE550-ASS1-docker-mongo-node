# SWE550-ASS1-docker-mongo-node
docker project
Docker allows us to execute services in isolation from our infrastructure, allowing us to provide software rapidly. We utilized the Visual Studio Code tool in our project, and the nodejs (JavaScript) application and Mongodb database will be deployed in two Docker containers. These will also need to be connected to the same network in order to interact with one another.
To start all the services defined in a docker-compose.yml by command 
$docker-compose up
